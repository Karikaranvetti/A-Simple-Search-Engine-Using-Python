<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">US reported more than 10,000 Covid-19 deaths in four days. And the impacts of Thanksgiving will only make things worse, experts warn</h2>    
<p>(CNN) - Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are at record-high levels nationwide, and officials expect the US will soon bear the full brunt of another surge of infections fueled by Thanksgiving gatherings. </p>    
<p>"We have not yet seen the full effect of a potential surge upon a surge," Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN Friday night. "The travel associated with Thanksgiving, the congregating at family and social gatherings with people indoors, sometimes without masks. So that may peak two to three weeks from now."</p>    
<p>And that surge will come right as travel and social gatherings will likely pick up again for the Christmas holiday. </p>    
<p>"So, we're really very concerned," Fauci said. </p>    
<p>The bleak forecast comes as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine advisers are scheduled to meet to discuss Pfizer's and Moderna's applications for emergency use authorization of their Covid-19 vaccines, which some state leaders say they're expecting to get the first doses of in the coming weeks. </p>    
<p>But health officials warn that while some Americans may receive a vaccine by the end of the year, the country likely won't see any meaningful impacts until late spring. </p>    
<p>In the meantime, experts project incredibly challenging next few months. </p>    
<p>Another 260,000 deaths projected in coming months</p>    
<p>On Friday, more than 220,000 new infections were reported -- the highest number since the pandemic's start. And more than 101,200 people are hospitalized with Covid-19 nationwide -- another record, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Hospital systems across the country are hitting their breaking points. </p>    
<p>In Miami-Dade County, Chief Medical Officer Peter Paige says hospitalizations have spiked by nearly 140% over the past two months, while ICU rates have jumped 58% over the same time period. </p>    
<p>"This is particularly concerning considering we really don't know that the most challenging days may still be ahead of us," Paige said.</p>    
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti on Friday called the accelerating pandemic "the greatest threat to life in Los Angeles that we have ever faced." Hospitalizations in Los Angeles County have tripled in the last week, he said, and the county will likely run out of beds in two to four weeks if cases continue climbing.</p>    
<p>And more than 10,000 people have died of Covid-19 this month -- with every day in December so far seeing more than 2,500 daily deaths reported across the US.</p>    
<p>The University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projects daily deaths will peak at more than 2,900 in mid-January. </p>    
<p>So far, more than 278,800 people have lost their lives to the virus in the US since the pandemic's start. The IHME predicts there will be about another 260,000 American deaths over the next four months. </p>    
<p>"We are facing a number of pretty grim months ahead," Dr. Chris Murray, the IHME director, said Friday night. "Although the hope of vaccines is there, it's not going to come in time to deal with that January, February surge.</p>    
<p>Here's when most Americans will begin getting vaccinated</p>    
<p>Meanwhile, Fauci told CNN Friday night that healthy, non-elderly Americans with no known underlying health conditions will likely start getting vaccinated in late March to early April. </p>    
<p>"Once you get into April, probably full blast with those individuals," Fauci said. "That's the reason why what we would really like to see is that once you get into the 'open season,' in the sense that anybody can get it, that we really have a full-court press on getting people vaccinated, because the quicker you get the overwhelming majority of the country vaccinated, the quicker you're going to have that umbrella of herd immunity -- which would be so, so important in bringing the level of that virus way, way down to below the threatening level."</p>    
<p>"The sooner we get there, the better we are."</p>    
<p>Earlier this week, vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted 13-1 to recommend that both health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities be first in line for any vaccines that get the green light from the FDA. </p>    
<p>Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday at least 20 million Americans are expected to be able to get the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of the month.</p>    
<p>"The FDA will also be considering emergency use authorization of the Pfizer vaccine after the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting on December 10, and we anticipate the Moderna vaccine will be considered by the committee the following week," Giroir said in recorded remarks during a meeting of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee hosted by HHS Friday.</p>    
<p>"We all expect these to be the first and second of a number of vaccines to be considered for an EUA."</p>    
<p>Face masks remain critical tools</p>    
<p>But the start of vaccinations will not mean an end to Covid-19, health officials warn. </p>    
<p>"Vaccines and vaccination will add a major, major, powerful tool to the tool kit that we have," Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme, said. "But by themselves they will not do the job."</p>    
<p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added governments should not drop their guard, saying health care systems could still buckle under the pressure.</p>    
<p>"Progress on vaccines gives us all a lift and we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel," he said. "However, WHO is concerned that there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over."</p>    
<p>Leading public health officials in the US have emphasized masks will continue to play a crucial role in helping curb the spread of the virus -- and save lives -- in the coming months. According to the IHME team, if 95% of Americans wore masks, about 66,000 lives could be saved by April 1. </p>    
<p>The CDC, which has been gradually strengthening its recommendations on mask use, said Friday masks remain "critical" to controlling the spread of Covid-19, including sometimes at home. </p>    
<p>"Because the highest risk for transmission has been documented among household contacts of Covid-19 patients, keeping the household safe requires physical distancing, using the other public health strategies summarized here, and, in particular, consistent and correct use of face masks (outside the household and in some circumstances within the household) to prevent introduction and transmission of (Covid-19)," the CDC team wrote.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Covid-19 has already exhausted the US. And it's only the start of a dark and deadly winter</h2>    
<p>(CNN) - For weeks, experts have warned Americans in increasingly dire terms that this winter will be one of the darkest periods in the nation's public health history.</p>    
<p>Now that time is upon us.</p>    
<p>From California to Kansas, Massachusetts to Florida, and everywhere in-between, doctors, nurses, funeral home directors and food bank organizers are bracing for a devastating season. They're already stretched thin and exhausted after months of confronting the deadly Covid-19 pandemic, but they fear the worst is still yet to come.</p>    
<p>"I think we're past the breaking point," said Dr. Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center in Southern California. "The staff is here, but they're broken."</p>    
<p>Edward's hospital on Thursday had just two beds left before its intensive care unit reaches capacity. A second field hospital with 50 beds has been built in part of their parking lot -- a scene reminiscent of the Air Force veteran's time in Baghdad.</p>    
<p>"I might really be back in a war zone," he said. "We're at war against Covid."</p>    
<p>Hospitals like El Centro have already been pushed to the brink as hospitalizations climb nationwide. But with colder temperatures pushing people indoors and a weary public eager to mark the holiday season, health care workers could be overrun.</p>    
<p>The numbers paint a bleak picture. On Thursday, the US had its highest day of new cases and deaths, with 217,664 and 2,879, respectively, according to Johns Hopkins University. And there were a record 100,667 hospitalizations, per the Covid Tracking Project.</p>    
<p>And while vaccines are on the way, the US has a long road ahead before it can return to normal.</p>    
<p>"The reality is, December and January and February are going to be rough times," Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned Wednesday. "I actually believe they're going to be the most difficult in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that's going to put on our health care system."</p>    
<p>There's a dire need for health care workers</p>    
<p>Nurses at Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital in New Rochelle, New York -- the East Coast's first Covid-19 hotspot -- took to the picket line this week, demanding better pay, more staffing and higher quality protective gear ahead of a potential surge in Covid-19 hospitalizations.</p>    
<p>"Right now, we have less staff than we had in the spring ... when Covid started," nurse Kathy Santoiemma told CNN affiliate News12 Westchester. "So we're not even worried -- we're terrified."</p>    
<p>The need for more staff is being felt in communities across the country. On Thursday, Massachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders announced plans to build a field hospital in Lowell, and she pleaded for people to step forward to staff the facility.</p>    
<p>"If you have the skills, the can-do attitude and have time to work in a hospital, we need you," she said. "Now is the time to step up and serve your neighbors, your community and your loved ones."</p>    
<p>Edward is also feeling the squeeze in El Centro. Despite the additional tent erected nearby, he's not certain the facility can take on more patients without more staff. Those already working in the hospital are "severely exhausted," he said, and some are falling ill.</p>    
<p>He doesn't expect the pandemic to let up any time soon, and he's not sure how much longer his staff can keep going.</p>    
<p>"The resiliency starts to break down at some point, regardless of how much I know that this team is willing to do," he said.</p>    
<p>Nurses at Hutchinson Regional Medical Center in Hutchinson, Kansas, are also dreading a potential surge in cases.</p>    
<p>"Two to three weeks we're going to be just swamped," nurse Mary Jones told CNN affiliate KWCH. Jones, who works in the Covid-19 unit, told the station she's lost more patients in the last couple months than she has in the last decade.</p>    
<p>"There are days that you go home and you're just not sure you're going to come back, days you get here and find out someone you were taking care of two days ago is gone," she said.</p>    
<p>And yet, nurses are still dealing with patients who deny the virus is even real, she said. One patient told Jones that "masks don't make any difference and Covid isn't really a thing -- it doesn't exist."</p>    
<p>Funeral homes are inundated</p>    
<p>That stress extends to all aspects of a community, including funeral homes like Frye Chapel &amp; Mortuary in Blythe, California, along the state's southeastern border with Arizona.</p>    
<p>Sheila Kruger, the funeral home's managing partner, told CNN her business has tripled. She's booked with funerals for the next four or five weeks, with the coronavirus accounting for a growing share of deaths.</p>    
<p>"We've had married couples that die within a day of each other, a husband and wife. We've had parents and children die within a week of each other. It's heart wrenching," she said.</p>    
<p>Kruger's staff was overwhelmed this summer, handling 135 deaths in one month compared to the average of 55. She's since doubled her staff and purchased additional refrigerated units to store bodies. But now they're filling up again.</p>    
<p>Experts believe the death toll is going to climb exponentially. Last week, Dr. Jonathan Reiner of George Washington University School of Medicine, predicted the rate of deaths would likely double in less than two weeks to an average of 4,000 a day.</p>    
<p>Kruger's not alone. In Rockford, Illinois, Tim Honquest, director of the Honquest Family Funeral Homes, told CNN affiliate WREX that his business ran out of refrigerated space to store bodies last month.</p>    
<p>His business nearly doubled in November alone -- conducting 54 funerals compared to the usual 30. Twenty-six of the funerals last month were due to Covid-19.</p>    
<p>While Kruger feels her staff can handle the boom in business, she believes some are suffering from post-traumatic stress, partly due to having to repeatedly inform grieving families they can't have a funeral for five weeks.</p>    
<p>"We're all just kind of cringing and saying, 'We do not want to do this again,'" she said.</p>    
<p>The demand for food is through the roof</p>    
<p>The needs aren't limited to medical staff. Many families are just trying to make ends meet.</p>    
<p>Karen Sosa waited in line at a Los Angeles food bank this week for the first time. She's been out of work for just two weeks, but her family has four children to feed, so they're taking advantage of the resources available.</p>    
<p>"We don't know when we're going to have income, so that means we don't know when we're going to be able to buy groceries," she said. "This is a good lifesaver. We don't know when we'll have money, but we'll at least have food."</p>    
<p>Sosa isn't alone. There are lines across the country, including in Miami, where Paco VÃ©lez, President and CEO of Feeding South Florida, said more than a thousand families lined up at a food distribution event on Thursday, to pick up boxes filled with milk, pre-cooked chicken and a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>    
<p>But those boxes are funded in part by the US Department of Agriculture's Coronavirus Food Assistance program -- and that help ends this week.</p>    
<p>"These food boxes run out at the end of this week ... and then the rest of December we're going to have to figure out how we're going to bring in food to make sure that these families have enough food for the rest of the month," VÃ©lez said.</p>    
<p>Los Angeles Regional Food Bank President and CEO Michael Flood says his organization's food distribution is up 145% -- unprecedented demand. Every day, he sees families worried about keeping a roof over their heads and where they'll get their next meal. And many of those seeking help are doing so for the first time, like Sosa.</p>    
<p>"We don't really know when this is going to end," he said.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Singer Jeremih leaves hospital after battling Covid-19 and thanks health care workers for saving his life</h2>    
<p>(CNN) - R&amp;B singer Jeremih is now out of a hospital after his battle with coronavirus left him in an intensive care unit last month.  </p>    
<p>In a statement issued by his family, the 33-year-old entertainer thanked the staff at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital for keeping him alive. </p>    
<p>"First and foremost I would like to thank God and the incredible team of doctors and nurses at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for saving my life," the statement, obtained by CNN Saturday, reads. "I will be forever grateful. I would also like to thank my family and friends for all their prayers and well wishes." </p>    
<p>He said he also continues to thank the artists Chance The Rapper, 50 Cent and Diddy for "their love and support" and extends gratitude to his fans and people around the world who prayed for him. </p>    
<p>"I'm getting stronger every day, and look forward to spending time with my sons," he said. </p>    
<p>More than two weeks ago, Jeremih's family issued a statement saying he was on a ventilator to help him breathe as he fought Covid-19 in an intensive care unit. </p>    
<p>The singer/songwriter's first Top 10 hit was 2009's "Birthday Sex."</p>    
<p>He's had more hits since and successful collaborations with other artists, including Ty Dolla Sign and YG.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">'Harder, scarier and lonelier than necessary.' Kansas man pens powerful obituary after losing father to Covid-19</h2>    
<p>(CNN) - Courtney Farr says one of the hardest parts of losing his father to Covid-19 earlier this week was knowing he wasn't surrounded by his loved ones in his last moments.</p>    
<p>"When my mother passed away about two years ago, I was able to sit with her ... and I was able to hold her hand and caress her face, I was able to be present with her," Farr told CNN's Don Lemon Friday night. "And I was able to comfort her the same way that she had comforted me so many times in my life."</p>    
<p>"With my father, we couldn't do that, because he was in isolation," Farr said. </p>    
<p>He says his family was able to say goodbye to his father, Marvin James Farr, virtually, the morning before he died. </p>    
<p>"I'm glad I got to see him one last time, to tell him how much I loved him, how much he mattered to me. But in that moment, what you want to be able to do is you want to be able to reach out and hold his hand, to touch him, to spend as much time with him as you can."</p>    
<p>Farr's story echoes the experiences of thousands of other families across the US who have had to say a final goodbye to parents, siblings and other family members through a device because of Covid-19 isolation protocols. More than 278,900 Americans have died since the pandemic's start. </p>    
<p>Farr says it was the building anger, fear, sorrow and frustration that led him to write a powerful obituary for his father, highlighting the toll of the pandemic and some Americans' rejection of public safety measures like face masks. </p>    
<p>"He was preceded in death by more than 260,000 Americans infected with Covid-19. He died in a room not his own, being cared for by people dressed in confusing and frightening ways. He died with Covid-19 and his final days were harder, scarier and lonelier than necessary," an excerpt from the obituary, read aloud by Lemon, said. </p>    
<p>His father, 81, was a veterinarian, Farr wrote. The science that guided his father's professional life has now "been disparaged and abandoned by so many of the same people who depended on his knowledge," he wrote. </p>    
<p>It is "strange," Farr told Lemon, that some Americans seem to deny the science touted by leading health experts in this pandemic. </p>    
<p>He says when he was growing up, he remembers medical professionals were highly respected, and doctors and nurses in his hometown were deemed some of the most important members of the community. Now, those same people who are "putting their own lives at risk" are attacked on social media. </p>    
<p>"It's unfathomable to me, it violates everything I feel like I learned growing up about decency and care for others," he said. "And those are lessons I learned from my father."</p>    
<p>His father, he wrote, was "born into an America recovering from the Great Depression and about to face World War 2, times of loss and sacrifice difficult for most of us to imagine. Americans would be asked to ration essential supplies and send their children around the world to fight and die in wars of unfathomable destruction."</p>    
<p>"He died in a world where many of his fellow Americans refuse to wear a piece of cloth on their face to protect one another," he wrote.</p>    
<p>In many ways, Farr told Lemon, he felt his father's death was political. </p>    
<p>"When our local city councils, when our state legislatures, when they are refusing to enact policies that can protect people, they've made political decisions that result in people like my father dying the way that they are."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">An Alabama woman is raising 12 kids after her sister and brother-in-law died from Covid-19</h2>    
<p>(CNN) - Francesca McCall and her younger sister Chantale had always promised to take care of each other's kids if anything ever happened to either.</p>    
<p>When Chantale died in September from Covid-19, her sister, who was already raising seven kids of her own, didn't hesitate to welcome Chantale's five children into her Birmingham, Alabama, home.</p>    
<p>"We always said that we didn't want our kids to be separated. We wanted our kids to stay together," McCall, 40, told CNN.</p>    
<p>The 12 children range in age from 1 to 17, and McCall, who's a single mother, said living together has been a challenge.</p>    
<p>"We have all the boys in one room and we have all the girls in the other two rooms, so everybody's kind of just on top of one another," she said. "So we've been making the best out of the situation."</p>    
<p>McCall said Chantale McCall was doing well when she was first hospitalized in Selma, where she lives, but her condition worsened and she was taken to a Birmingham hospital and put on a ventilator.</p>    
<p>She died on September 16 and her husband, Rance Martin, died from the disease on October 25 -- which would have been Chantale's 35th birthday.</p>    
<p>McCall said she and her mother and children had stayed with Chantale the weekend before she tested positive for Covid-19. Martin had been in and out of the hospital, but they didn't know he had the virus until later.</p>    
<p>The rest of the family tested negative for the coronavirus, despite their close contact, she said.</p>    
<p>McCall said her sister worked for a home health agency and was always very careful.</p>    
<p>"She did all the proper precautions. She wore the mask, she kept her distance, she did the proper hand washing and all the proper things she was supposed to do," McCall said.</p>    
<p>McCall said the kids are holding up, but it's been hard -- especially with Christmas coming soon.</p>    
<p>"They're doing okay at times and at times they break down, so they're having their days and their moments," she said. "It's been very hard losing their friends, church family and basically everything that's held dear to them."</p>    
<p>The children are all going to school virtually right now and aren't really eager to go to school in person because they don't want to risk getting Covid-19 or spreading it to someone else.</p>    
<p>McCall is able to work from home, for now, and her mother is staying with her to help out.</p>    
<p>"It's a little chaotic at times, trying to get everybody online for school and getting them fed before they get in school," she said. "Once you get them up and get them situated it's okay."</p>    
<p>She's also getting a lot of help from the community and her church.</p>    
<p>"She loves these children with all of [her] heart," said Carla McDonald, who's with the church, in a letter. "She is not the one to ask for assistance from anyone.  She is just trying to raise 12 children and meet their everyday needs not only for Christmas."</p>    
<p>McDonald helped create a GoFundMe campaign that has raised more than $56,000 for the family and said church members are doing other things for them.</p>    
<p>"I really, really appreciate it, McCall said.</p>    
<p>She said they're going to have a Christmas balloon release in Chantale's memory.</p>    
<p>"Our plan for Christmas is celebrating my sister's life and her legacy she leaves behind," McCall said.</p>
